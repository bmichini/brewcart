## Ingredients

#### Fermentables

* 11.0 lbs American 2-row
* 2.0 lbs UK Golden Promise
* 1.0 lbs Flaked Barley
* 1.0 lbs Flaked Wheat
* 1.0 lbs Flaked Oats

Total grain: 16.00 lbs

#### Hops

* 1.25 oz Amarillo (8.0% AA) @ First Wort Hop (add before lautering)
* 1.5 oz Amarillo (8.0% AA) @ flameout
* 1.0 oz Citra @ whirlpool 20 mins
* 1.0 oz Galaxy @ whirlpool 20 mins
* 1.0 oz Mosaic @ whirlpool 20 mins
* ~3.0 oz Citra @ dry hop~
* ~1.5 oz Galaxy @ dry hop~
* ~1.5 oz Mosaic @ dry hop~

Modified dry hop schedule - used Mosaic and Citra instead.

#### Yeast

* 300 billion cells GY054 Vermont IPA

#### Water

San Francisco municipal water (info [here](/docs/water.md)). Target 90 ppm Ca, and 1:2 ratio sulfate:chloride. Use 0.4 g/gal gypsum and 0.9 g/gal calcium chloride.

For mash water, add 1.0 mL/gal of 10% phosphoric acid to achieve mash pH of 5.4 (measured at room temperature).

For sparge water, adjust to 5.7 pH by adding 0.7 mL/gal of 10% phosphoric acid.

## Process

Mash all grains. Infusion mash, thickness 1.6 qts/lb (6.4 gal for 16.0 lbs grain).

* 152 degF (60 mins) saccharification
* 168 degF (10 mins) mash out

Batch sparge, collecting 3.9 gallons with first batch, and 3.9 gallons with second batch.

Target pre-boil volume: 7.83 gal. Target pre-boil gravity: 1.057.

Boil 60 min. Whirlpool and chill within 20 minutes after knockout.

## Fermentation and Conditioning

* Ferment at 68 degF for 1 week, allowing temperature to rise to about 72-75 degF after the first 3 days. Ensure desired attenuation before cold crashing.
* Add dry hops to primary

Measured mash pH after 10 mins: XXX @ room temp (or about XXX at mash temperature).

Measured sparge water pH (with 0.7 mL/gal acid added): XXX @ XXX degC.

Only collected 3.15 with first batch (should have collected 3.9).

Accidentally froze the beer (whoops!) again.

## Tasting Notes

Distinct vegetal/grassy notes early on. Could be due to the citra (noticed this in a Fieldwork beer with Citra hops)?
