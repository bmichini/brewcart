## Ingredients

#### Fermentables

* 4.5 lbs Weyermann Munich Type I
* 3.0 lbs Weyermann Pilsner
* 3.0 lbs Weyermann Vienna
* 0.5 lbs Briess Caramel 40L
* 0.5 lbs Weyermann Melanoidin

Total grain: 11.5 lbs

#### Hops

* 1.0 oz Hallertauer Mittelfrueh (5.0% AA) @ 60 minutes
* 0.5 oz Hallertauer Mittelfrueh (5.0% AA) @ 15 minutes

#### Yeast

* 450 billion cells WLP830 German Lager

#### Water

San Francisco municipal water (report [here](http://www.sfwater.org/index.aspx?page=634)). Target 85 ppm Ca, and 2:1 ratio chloride:sulfate.

Treat all brewing water with 0.75 g/gal of CaCl and 0.4 g/gal of gypsum (CaSO4).

Adjust sparge water to 5.7 pH by adding 2.2 mL/gal of 10% phosphoric acid.

## Process

Mash all grains. Step mash, thickness 2.0 qts/lb (5.75 gal for 11.5 lbs grain).

* 131 degF (10 mins) dough-in/protein rest
* 145 degF (30 mins) beta amylase saccharification
* 158 degF (30 mins) alpha amylase saccharification
* 168 degF (10 mins) mash out

Sparge over 40 minutes (~24 oz per minute or less). End sparge when either:

* Runoff gravity hits 1.010
* 7 gal of wort collected.

Target pre-boil volume: 7 gal. Target pre-boil gravity: 1.049.

Boil 90 min. Whirlpool and chill within 20 minutes after knockout to prevent DMS formation.

## Fermentation and Conditioning

* Ferment at 50 degF for 2 weeks or until FG reached
* Slowly raise to 60 degF for diacetyl rest for 1 day
* Slowly chill to lager temp
* Lager at 30-35 degF for 2+ weeks
