#### Water

San Francisco municipal water (info [here](/docs/water.md)). Target 85 ppm Ca, and 1:1 ratio sulfate:chloride. Use 0.6 g/gal gypsum and 0.6 g/gal calcium chloride.

For mash water, add 1.0 mL/gal of 10% phosphoric acid to achieve mash pH of 5.4 (measured at room temperature).

For sparge water, adjust to 5.7 pH by adding 0.7 mL/gal of 10% phosphoric acid.

## Process

Mash all grains. Infusion mash, thickness 2.05 qts/lb (5.5 gal for 10.75 lbs grain).

* 152 degF (60 mins) saccharification
* 168 degF (10 mins) mash out

Batch sparge, collecting 3.5 gallons with first batch, and 3.7 gallons with second batch.

Target pre-boil volume: 7.2 gal. Target pre-boil gravity: 1.041.

Boil 60 min. Whirlpool and chill within 20 minutes after knockout.

## Fermentation and Conditioning

* Start fermentation at 62 degF and hold for 3 days
* Slowly raise to 73 degF over next several days

| :-----------: |:---------:|
| Pre-boil SG   | 1.045     |
| Pre-boil vol  | 7.2 gal   |
| Post-boil vol | gal   |
| OG            | 1.051     |

Measured mash pH after 10 mins: ~5.44 @ room temp (or about 5.14 at mash temperature).

Final volume into fermentor (which includes 1.5L starter) was 5.5 gal.

About 0.5 gal of sanitizer solution got sucked into the fermentor when chilling.

## Tasting Notes

Tasted against Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier. Was able to distinguish in a triangle test, but was very close. Commercial version had a slightly more pronounced grainy or malty taste. Homebrew version also had a very slight metallic twinge (could be from the star san that was sucked in).
