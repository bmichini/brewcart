* **Style**: Belgian Tripel (BJCP2015 category 26C)
* **Brew date**: November 13, 2017
* **Target characteristics**: Complex, spicy Belgian trappist ale that is surprisingly drinkable despite its high alcohol content.

| Value      | Target |
| :--------: |:------:|
| OG         | 1.080  | 
| FG         | 1.010  | 
| ABV        | 9.2%   |

## Ingredients

#### Fermentables

* 15 lbs Dingeman's Belgian Pilsner
* 0.375 lbs (6 oz) Weyermann Melanoidin
* 2.75 lbs white sugar

Total fermentables: 18.125 lbs
Total grain: 15.375 lbs

#### Hops

* 1.0 oz Newport (11.1% AA) @ 60 minutes
* 1.0 oz Styrian Goldings (3.0% AA) @ 15 minutes

#### Misc

* 0.25 oz Coriander seed (crushed) @ 5 minutes

#### Yeast

* 330 billion cells Wyeast 1214 (Chimay strain, same as WLP500)

#### Water

San Francisco municipal water (info [here](/docs/water.md)). Target 85 ppm Ca, and 1:1 ratio sulfate:chloride. Use 0.6 g/gal gypsum and 0.6 g/gal calcium chloride.

For mash water, add 1.0 mL/gal of 10% phosphoric acid to achieve mash pH of 5.4 (measured at room temperature).

For sparge water, adjust to 5.7 pH by adding 0.7 mL/gal of 10% phosphoric acid.

## Process

Mash all grains. Step mash, thickness 1.56 qts/lb (6 gal for 15.375 lbs grain).

* 131 degF (10 mins) dough-in/protein rest
* 145 degF (60 mins) beta amylase saccharification
* 158 degF (15 mins) alpha amylase saccharification
* 168 degF (10 mins) mash out

Batch sparge, collecting 4 gallons with first batch, and 4 gallons with second batch. Add sugar in the kettle.

Target pre-boil volume: 8.0 gal. Target pre-boil gravity: 1.066 (after adding sugar).

Boil 90 min. Whirlpool and chill within 20 minutes after knockout.

## Fermentation and Conditioning

* Start fermentation at 65 degF
* 12 hours after pitching yeast, add more oxygen
* Slowly raise to 80-85 degF over several days

## Brewing Notes

Made starter with 2 packages of Wyeast 1214 (born-on date 9/20/2017 for ~60% viability) and 2L of 1.035 wort. Stir plate for 24 hours, then pitched directly to the wort. Estimated final cell count of ~330 billion. The starter did not show any signs of fermentation, though this yeast is apparently quite slow to start.

| Value         | Measured  |
| :-----------: |:---------:|
| Pre-boil SG   | 1.071     |
| Pre-boil vol  | 8.0 gal   |
| Post-boil vol | 6.7 gal   |
| OG            | 1.084     | 
| FG            |           | 
| AA            |           | 
| ABV           |           | 

Measured mash pH after 20 mins: ~5.70 @ room temp (or about 5.4 at mash temperature).

Sparge water pH was 6.95 @ room temp after adding 0.7 mL/gal of acid. Added anther 0.6 mL/gal (total of 1.3 mL/gal) and measured pH was 6.6. Added another 0.45 mL/gal (total 1.75 mL/gal) and measured pH was 6.2. Next time try adding more acid. Note all pH measurements were made at room temperature.

Collected only 3.5 gal in first batch, and 4.5 gal in second batch.

Boil kettle volumes during boil:

* 8.02 gal @ 90 mins (2500 W)
* 7.61 gal @ 50 mins (rate: 0.6 gal per hour) (increased to 3000 W)
* 6.70 gal @ 0 mins

Chilled to ~67 degF, oxygenated, and pitched entire 2L starter. Set fridge to 65 degF. Added more oxygen at 12 hours - no visible activity. After 36 hours there was significant visible fermentation activity.
