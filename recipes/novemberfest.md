# Novemberfest

* **Style**: Oktoberfest/MÃ¤rzen (BJCP2015 category 6A)
* **Brew date**: October 15, 2017
* **Target characteristics**: Clean, light- to medium-bodied German lager with strong malt presence. Full of malt flavor and depth, yet easily drinkable.

| Value      | Target |
| :--------: |:------:|
| OG         | 1.057  | 
| FG         | 1.011  | 
| ABV        | 6.1%   |   
| SRM        | 9      |   
| IBU        | 20     |   

## Ingredients

#### Fermentables

* 4.5 lbs Weyermann Munich Type I
* 3.0 lbs Weyermann Pilsner
* 3.0 lbs Weyermann Vienna
* 0.5 lbs Briess Caramel 40L
* 0.5 lbs Weyermann Melanoidin

Total grain: 11.5 lbs

#### Hops

* 1.0 oz Hallertauer Mittelfrueh (5.0% AA) @ 60 minutes
* 0.5 oz Hallertauer Mittelfrueh (5.0% AA) @ 15 minutes

#### Yeast

* 450 billion cells WLP830 German Lager

#### Water

San Francisco municipal water (report [here](http://www.sfwater.org/index.aspx?page=634)). Target 85 ppm Ca, and 2:1 ratio chloride:sulfate.

Treat all brewing water with 0.75 g/gal of CaCl and 0.4 g/gal of gypsum (CaSO4).

Adjust sparge water to 5.7 pH by adding 2.2 mL/gal of 10% phosphoric acid.

## Process

Mash all grains. Step mash, thickness 2.0 qts/lb (5.75 gal for 11.5 lbs grain).

* 131 degF (10 mins) dough-in/protein rest
* 145 degF (30 mins) beta amylase saccharification
* 158 degF (30 mins) alpha amylase saccharification
* 168 degF (10 mins) mash out

Sparge over 40 minutes (~24 oz per minute or less). End sparge when either:

* Runoff gravity hits 1.010
* 7 gal of wort collected.

Target pre-boil volume: 7 gal. Target pre-boil gravity: 1.049.

Boil 90 min. Whirlpool and chill within 20 minutes after knockout to prevent DMS formation.

## Fermentation and Conditioning

* Ferment at 50 degF for 2 weeks or until FG reached
* Slowly raise to 60 degF for diacetyl rest for 1 day
* Slowly chill to lager temp
* Lager at 30-35 degF for 2+ weeks

## Brewing Notes

Pump recirculation rate during mash was 1.8 gpm.

Boil kettle power setting seemed best at about 2000W, which resulting in about 0.72 gal/hr evaporation rate. Running at 2500W resulted in about a 1.25 gal/hr evaporation rate.

| Value         | Measured  |
| :-----------: |:---------:|
| Pre-boil SG   | 1.047     |
| Pre-boil vol  | 7 gal     |
| Post-boil vol | ~5.75 gal |
| OG            | 1.057     | 
| FG            |           | 
| AA            |           |

Oxygenated and pitched yeast ~12 hours after chilling to 50 degF. Airlock activity after 24 hours - about 1 bubble per second.

9 days after pitching yeast, measured gravity was 1.019. Noted a slight buttery diacetyl mouthfeel.

Started diacetyl rest 11 days after pitching yeast. Raise temperature by 5 degF per day to 65 degF, and let sit at 65 degF for 2 days. Then lower by 5 degF per day to lagering temperature. Due to a temperature controller error, accidentally raised the beer temperature from 50 degF to 60 degF in one day. Remainder of profile was followed normally.

Transferred to corny keg 16 days after pitching yeast (when at 45 degF). Beer filled almost the entire keg. Moved to refrigerator set to 35 degF for lagering.

Gravity reading at 18 days after pitching yeast was 1.015 (4 points above target FG), for an apparent attenuation of 73% (WLP830 should be 74-79%). Possbile causes of under-attenuation:

* Beta amylase saccharification too short (only 30 minutes, maybe longer needed)
* Not long enough primary fermentation (try 2 weeks next time)
* Not enough oxygen at beginning of fermentation (try longer O2 injection/finer bubbles)
* Yeast: not viable enough (amount should have been OK at 1.7 million cells/mL-degPlato)
* Not long enough diacetyl rest (try 2-3 days next time)
* Temperature swings during fermentation (controller error)
* other stuff?

## Tasting Notes

4 weeks after brewing: Side-by-side tasting with commercial example. Our beer was much sweeter and 'heavier', and had what could be described as a bubblegum note.

* Did the beer achieve target characteristics?
* Photos of the beer
