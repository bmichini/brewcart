| Pre-boil SG   | 1.038     |
| Pre-boil vol  | 9.0 gal   |

Added 1.0 mL/gal of acid to mash water.

Measured mash pH after 20 mins: 5.77 @ 30 degC (or about 5.5 at mash temperature.. too high!).

Too much water! Targeted 8.5 gal pre-boil volume and got 9.0 gal. Grain only absorbed about .3 qt/lb.



## Tasting Notes

Orange stands out, could add a touch more 

Tasted vs. Allagash White. Allash was more carbonated and much paler (light straw yellow), whereas ours was a bit more red. Allagash had more of a lemon-y citrus (ours was more orange-y). Ours was fuller bodied. Nelson hops were a nice touch. Ours was slightly more bitter. Allagash had more yeast character (like a mini Tripel).
