## Ingredients

#### Fermentables

* 15 lbs Dingeman's Belgian Pilsner
* 0.375 lbs (6 oz) Weyermann Melanoidin
* 2.75 lbs white sugar

Total fermentables: 18.125 lbs
Total grain: 15.375 lbs

#### Hops

* 1.0 oz Newport (11.1% AA) @ 60 minutes
* 1.0 oz Styrian Goldings (3.0% AA) @ 15 minutes

#### Yeast

* 330 billion cells Wyeast 1214 (Chimay strain, same as WLP500)

#### Water

San Francisco municipal water (info [here](/docs/water.md)). Target 85 ppm Ca, and 1:1 ratio sulfate:chloride. Use 0.6 g/gal gypsum and 0.6 g/gal calcium chloride.

For mash water, add 1.0 mL/gal of 10% phosphoric acid to achieve mash pH of 5.4 (measured at room temperature).

For sparge water, adjust to 5.7 pH by adding 0.7 mL/gal of 10% phosphoric acid.

## Process

Mash all grains. Step mash, thickness 1.56 qts/lb (6 gal for 15.375 lbs grain).

* 131 degF (10 mins) dough-in/protein rest
* 145 degF (60 mins) beta amylase saccharification
* 158 degF (15 mins) alpha amylase saccharification
* 168 degF (10 mins) mash out

Batch sparge, collecting 4 gallons with first batch, and 4 gallons with second batch. Add sugar in the kettle.

Target pre-boil volume: 8.0 gal. Target pre-boil gravity: XX (after adding sugar).

Boil 90 min. Whirlpool and chill within 20 minutes after knockout.

## Fermentation and Conditioning

* Start fermentation at 65 degF
* 12 hours after pitching yeast, add more oxygen
* Slowly raise to 80-85 degF over several days
