#### Water

San Francisco municipal water (info [here](/docs/water.md)). Target 90 ppm Ca, and 3:1 ratio sulfate:chloride. Use 1.0 g/gal gypsum and 0.3 g/gal calcium chloride.

For mash water, add 1.0 mL/gal of 10% phosphoric acid to achieve mash pH of 5.4 (measured at room temperature).

For sparge water, adjust to 5.7 pH by adding 0.7 mL/gal of 10% phosphoric acid.

## Process

Mash all grains. Infusion mash, thickness 1.6 qts/lb (6.7 gal for 16.75 lbs grain).

* 152 degF (60 mins) saccharification
* 168 degF (10 mins) mash out

Batch sparge, collecting 3.9 gallons with first batch, and 3.9 gallons with second batch.

Target pre-boil volume: 7.83 gal. Target pre-boil gravity: 1.059.

Boil 60 min. Whirlpool and chill within 20 minutes after knockout.

## Fermentation and Conditioning

* Ferment at 66 degF for 1 week, allowing temperature to rise to about 72-75 degF after the first 3 days. Ensure desired attenuation before cold crashing.
* Add dry hops to primary
