# Coffee IPA

* **Style**: Specialty IPA (BJCP2015 category 21B)
* **Brew date**: November 1, 2017
* **Target characteristics**: IPA with hop flavors and aromas tending toward tropical fruit, citrus, passionfruit, and pine. Super strong hop presence, but balance and synergy between hop flavors and fruity, mildly roasty coffee notes.

## Ingredients

#### Fermentables

* 14.0 lbs UK Golden Promise
* 1.5 lbs Weyermann Munich
* 0.2 lbs (3 oz) Simpson's coffee malt
* 0.5 lbs dextrose

Total fermentables: 16.2 lbs

#### Hops

* 1.0 oz Columbus/Tomahawk (11.6% AA) @ 60 minutes
* 1.0 oz Azacca (10.4% AA) @ 60 minutes
* 1.0 oz Motueka (6.1% AA) @ flameout (15 minute stand)
* 1.0 oz Azacca (10.4% AA) @ flameout (15 minute stand)
* 1.0 oz Citra (11.8% AA) @ flameout (15 minute stand)
* 1.0 oz Mosaic (11.5% AA) @ flameout (15 minute stand)
* 1.0 oz Centennial (9.3% AA) (whole leaf) @ hopback
* 2.0 oz Azacca @ dry hop (3 days)
* 2.0 oz Mosaic @ dry hop (3 days)
* 2.0 oz Motueka @ dry hop (3 days)

Total hops: 13 oz (holy smokes!)

#### Yeast

* 300 billion cells WLP001 California Ale

#### Water

San Francisco municipal water (info [here](/docs/water.md)). Target 90 ppm Ca, and 3:1 ratio sulfate:chloride. Use 1.0 g/gal gypsum and 0.3 g/gal calcium chloride.

For mash water, add 1.0 mL/gal of 10% phosphoric acid to achieve mash pH of 5.35 (measured at room temperature).

For sparge water, adjust to 5.7 pH by adding 0.7 mL/gal of 10% phosphoric acid.

## Process

Mash all grains. Mash thickness 1.53 qts/lb (6 gal for 15.7 lbs grain).

* 150 degF (60 mins) saccharification
* 168 degF (10 mins) mash out

Batch sparge, collecting 4 gallons with first batch, and 3.5 gallons with second batch. Add dextrose in the kettle.

Target pre-boil volume: 7.5 gal. Target pre-boil gravity: 1.064 (after adding dextrose).

Boil 60 min. Whirlpool and chill within 20 minutes after knockout. Add hops continuously during the whirlpool for a variety of aromatics in the finished beer.

## Fermentation and Conditioning

* Ferment at 66 degF for 1 week, allowing temperature to rise to about 72-75 degF after the first 3 days. Ensure desired attenuation before cold crashing.
* Cold-condition 35 degF for 2 weeks
* Add dry hops just prior to serving
* Blend cold-brew coffee into beer just after dry hopping

Test blending coffee into beer at rates around 1% coffee by volume.

## Brewing Notes

Made starter with 2 packs of WLP001 (born-on date 8/19/2017 for 50% viability) and 2L of 1.035 wort. Stir plate for 18 hours, then cold crash and decant. Estimated final cell count of ~300 billion.

Forgot to add brewing salts and acid until 5 minutes into the mash.

| Value         | Measured  |
| :-----------: |:---------:|
| Pre-boil SG   | 1.059     |
| Pre-boil vol  | 7.5 gal   |
| Post-boil vol | ~6.5 gal  |
| OG            | 1.069     | 
| FG            | 1.010     | 
| ABV           | 7.8%      | 

Measured pre-boil gravity (after adding dextrose) was 1.059, and target was 1.064 (indicates our efficiency is probably closer to 70% rather than 75%). Boiled for 75 minutes and a bit harder to reach target OG.

Boiled off 0.96 gal over 75 min (11% per hour evaporation rate) with kettle set to 2500 W for the entire boil.

Chilled to about 70 degF, chilled down a bit, and pitched yeast to ~65 degF wort.

7 days after pitching yeast, gravity was 1.011. Good hop aroma and flavor.

11/13 transferred to keg, refracto reading 8.2 brix (specific gravity of 1.010).

Beer was loosely inspired by Rogue Cold Brew IPA and Oskar Blues IPA blended with cold brew coffe.
