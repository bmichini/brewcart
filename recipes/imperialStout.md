## Ingredients

#### Fermentables

* 16.8 lbs American 2-row
* 1.2 lbs Carastan/Crystal 20
* 1.2 lbs Crystal 120
* 0.6 lbs Brown Malt
* 0.6 lbs Chocolate Maly
* 0.3 lbs Roasted Barley

Total grain: 20.7 lbs

#### Hops

* 2.0 oz Crystal (5.7% AA) @ 60 minutes
* 1.0 oz Centennial (9.7% AA) @ flameout
* 1.0 oz Northern Brewer (7.3% AA) @ flameout

#### Yeast

* 330 billion cells WLP001 California Ale

#### Water

San Francisco municipal water (info [here](/docs/water.md)). Target 85 ppm Ca, and 1:1 ratio sulfate:chloride. Use 0.6 g/gal gypsum and 0.6 g/gal calcium chloride.

For mash water, add 1.0 mL/gal of 10% phosphoric acid to achieve mash pH of 5.4 (measured at room temperature).

For sparge water, adjust to 5.7 pH by adding 0.7 mL/gal of 10% phosphoric acid.

## Process

Mash all grains. Infusion mash, thickness 1.25 qts/lb (6.5 gal for 20.7 lbs grain).

* 152 degF (60 mins) saccharification
* 168 degF (10 mins) mash out

Batch sparge, collecting 3.35 gallons with first batch, and 3.35 gallons with second batch.

Target pre-boil volume: 6.7 gal. Target pre-boil gravity: 1.079.

Boil 60 min. Whirlpool and chill within 20 minutes after knockout.

## Fermentation and Conditioning

* Start fermentation at 68 degF
* 12 hours after pitching yeast, add more oxygen
* Slowly raise to 73 degF over several days

## Brewing Notes

| Value         | Measured  |
| :-----------: |:---------:|
| Pre-boil SG   | 1.075     |
| Pre-boil vol  | 6.7 gal   |
| Post-boil vol | 5.6 gal   |
| OG            | 1.091     | 
| FG            | 1.024     | 
| AA            | 72%       | 
| ABV           | 8.8%      | 

Added ~1.15 mL/gal of phosphoric to mash water to get to 5.7.

Measured mash pH after 10 mins: ~5.10 @ room temp (or about 4.9 at mash temperature) - a little bit low (probably due to roasted malts).

Only collected 2.8 gal on first batch - needed to collect 3.9 on second batch (need to account for RIMS rocket dead space next time, 8" tall 5" diameter = ~0.7 gal)

Transferred to barrel (which was previously used for a chocolate stout-distilled bourbon) 15 days after pitching. Specific gravity 1.024.
